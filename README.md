BAroQUe: Bentley Audiovisual Quality control Utility

The **Bentley Audiovisual Quality control Utility (BAroQUe)** is a Python 3-based Command Line Interface (CLI) computer program primarily intended for in-house use. It performs Quality Control (QC)--with microservices for: 1) file naming and organization; 2) METS validation and verification; 3) WAV BEXT chunk validation and verification; 4) file format validation; and 5) checksum verification--for audio (and, eventually, video) digitized by vendors according to Bentley specifications.
